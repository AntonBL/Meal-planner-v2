## [Unreleased]

### Added - 2025-11-28

#### Conversational Recipe Generation
- **Free-Form Preference Input**: Added text input field for custom preferences during recipe generation

  - Preferences are incorporated into AI prompt for all generated recipes
  - Simple, unobtrusive single-line input field below meal type selector

  - **Real-Time Refinement**: Modify recipes through natural conversation
  - **Conversation History**: Full chat history maintained per recipe in session state
  - **In-Place Updates**: Recipes update directly based on conversation (no duplicates)
  - **Smart Context**: AI maintains context of original recipe and conversation history
  - **Example Use Cases**:
    - Adjust spice levels ("make this spicier" / "make this milder")
    - Ingredient substitutions ("what if I don't have bell peppers?")
    - Time constraints ("can you make this in 20 minutes?")
    - Dietary modifications ("make this oil-free", "add more protein")
    - Ingredient swaps ("use mushrooms instead of tofu")

- **New LLM Agent Methods**:
  - `RecipeGenerator.refine_recipe()` - Handles chat-based recipe refinement
  - `_build_refinement_prompt()` - Constructs prompts with conversation context
  - `_parse_single_recipe()` - Parses refined recipe responses
  - Added `additional_context` parameter to `suggest_recipes()`
