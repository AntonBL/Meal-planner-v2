    "content": "Yes, you can absolutely add cabbage to this roast! Since cabbage cooks faster than dense root vegetables like potatoes and turnips, I recommend cutting it into thick wedges or 1-inch ribbons and adding it to the sheet pan during the last 15–20 minutes of roasting. This ensures it gets those crispy, charred edges without turning into mush. Given the balsamic-herb glaze in the recipe, the cabbage will caramelize beautifully and add a nice savory depth to the medley.\n\nRegarding the base, **couscous** is the better choice for this specific recipe. Its light, fluffy texture acts as a perfect bed for the chunky roasted vegetables and will soak up any extra balsamic glaze without becoming heavy. Polenta has a creamy, porridge-like consistency that might compete with the soft texture of the roasted squash and butterball potatoes, potentially making the dish feel one-dimensional.\n\nTo serve, fluff the couscous with a little olive oil and some of the freshly chopped **parsley** and **negi scallions** from your ingredient list. Top it with the roasted vegetable and cabbage mixture for a balanced, vibrant autumn bowl."
