**Ingredients:**
- Pasta (any shape)
- Mixed vegetables (zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli, cherry tomatoes)

## Tom Yum Soup
**Cuisine:** Thai
**Type:** Soup
**Last made:** 2025-11-08

**Ingredients:**
- Vegetable broth
- Mushrooms, tomatoes
- Tofu
- Lemongrass, galangal, lime leaves (if we can find them)
- Lime juice, chili paste

Delicious but requires special ingredients we don't always have (lemongrass, galangal). When we have the ingredients, it's great. Might try simplifying with just ginger and lime.
