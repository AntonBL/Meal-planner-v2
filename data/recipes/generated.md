## Penne alla Vodka with Crispy Tofu, Roasted Eggplant & Spinach
**Added to plan:** 2025-11-29
**Time:** 33 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy

A creamy Italian pasta dish with a tomato-vodka sauce, topped with pan-fried tofu and roasted eggplant for protein and depth, plus fresh spinach for brightness. Rich, satisfying, and ready in under 35 minutes.

**Ingredients:**
- Penne pasta
- extra-firm tofu
- eggplant
- canned tomatoes
- spinach
- garlic
- onions
- olive oil
- butter
- parmesan cheese
- salt
- black pepper
- red pepper flakes
- basil
- Heavy cream or whole milk (can substitute oat milk)
- vodka (optional but recommended for authentic flavor)

**Instructions:**
1. Cut eggplant into 3/4-inch cubes, toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread on a baking sheet and roast at 400°F for 12-14 minutes until golden and tender. Set aside.
2. While eggplant roasts, cut tofu into 3/4-inch cubes and pan-fry in olive oil over medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes until golden and crispy on all sides. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
3. Bring salted water to boil and cook penne according to package directions. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining.
4. While pasta cooks, sauté minced garlic and diced onion in butter and olive oil over medium heat for 3-4 minutes until softened.
5. Add crushed canned tomatoes (about 1.5 cans) and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup vodka (or skip if preferred) and let simmer 2 minutes.
6. Reduce heat to low and stir in 1/2 cup cream or milk. Add half the spinach and stir until wilted, then add remaining spinach.
7. Toss cooked penne into sauce, adding pasta water as needed to reach desired consistency. Gently fold in roasted eggplant. Top with crispy tofu, fresh basil, and parmesan cheese.

**Why this recipe:** Added roasted eggplant as a second protein element that complements the tofu while adding smoky depth and meaty texture. Eggplant is roasted separately to prevent wateriness and maintain firm texture. Time increased by 5 minutes to accommodate roasting step. Recipe remains fully vegetarian.
