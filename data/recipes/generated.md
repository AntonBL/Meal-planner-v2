## Vegetarian Sopa Azteca (Tortilla Soup) with Toasted Dried Chili
**Added to plan:** 2025-11-29
**Time:** 55 minutes
**Difficulty:** Medium

A classic Mexican tomato-based soup enriched with toasted, smoky dried chilies and charred tomatoes for deeper, more complex flavors, loaded with crispy tortilla strips, avocado, and fresh cilantro - a restaurant favorite made vegetarian with enhanced caramelized depth.

**Ingredients:**
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- Tomatoes (6 large or 2 28oz cans)
- vegetable broth (6 cups)
- onion (1 medium)
- garlic (4 cloves)
- jalapeño (1)
- dried chiles (2-3
- such as ancho or guajillo)
- corn tortillas (6-8)
- avocado (2)
- fresh cilantro (1/2 cup chopped)
- lime (2)
- salt
- pepper
- optional: queso fresco (1/2 cup crumbled)
- epazote (2 tbsp fresh)

**Instructions:**
1. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (1 minute)
2. Place 2-3 dried chiles in a dry skillet over medium heat, toast for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, shaking occasionally to avoid burning
3. Remove stems and seeds from toasted chiles and set aside
4. In the same dry skillet, char 6 diced tomatoes over medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly blackened and caramelized
5. Add 1 diced onion and 4 minced garlic cloves to the pot with oil, sauté until fragrant (2-3 minutes)
6. Add charred tomatoes and 1 diced jalapeño to pot, cook for 2 minutes
7. Add toasted chiles to pot and cook for 1 minute to bloom flavors
8. Pour in 6 cups vegetable broth and bring to a simmer (3-5 minutes)
9. Simmer uncovered for 15-18 minutes until flavors meld
10. Blend soup using immersion blender until smooth, or carefully blend in batches (3-5 minutes total)
11. Season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice to taste (1-2 minutes)
12. While soup simmers, cut 6-8 tortillas into 1/4-inch strips, toss with 1 tbsp olive oil and salt
13. Bake tortilla strips on a baking sheet at 375°F for 8-10 minutes until golden and crispy, stirring halfway through
14. Slice 2 avocados into 1/4-inch pieces (2 minutes)
15. Ladle soup into bowls and top with crispy tortilla strips, avocado slices, fresh cilantro, queso fresco if desired, and an additional squeeze of fresh lime juice
16. Serve immediately

**Why this recipe:** Recipe updated to incorporate toasting the dried chiles first (enhancing smokiness), charring the tomatoes for caramelized depth, and adding lime juice during seasoning to brighten flavors. These techniques deepen complexity and create a more authentic, restaurant-quality result. Time increased by 5 minutes to account for charring tomatoes.
