# 👎 Not Again

Recipes we tried but didn't enjoy.

## Quinoa Salad
**Cuisine:** Mediterranean
**Tried:** 2025-11-10
**Rating:** 2/5

**Why we didn't like it:**
Texture was weird for both of us. Neither of us is a fan of quinoa apparently. Too much effort for something we didn't enjoy.

## Baked Cod with Lemon
**Cuisine:** American
**Tried:** 2025-10-28
**Rating:** 2/5

**Why we didn't like it:**
Fish was bland and dry even though we followed the recipe. Prefer other fish preparations. Might try pan-seared next time instead of baked.
