    "content": "Yes, cabbage is a wonderful addition to this soup. Its mild, earthy sweetness complements the leeks and potatoes perfectly without overpowering the delicate flavors of thyme and lemon. Since this is a \"silky\" soup, adding cabbage will provide extra body and fiber, though it may make the final texture slightly more fibrous if you plan on blending it completely.\n\nTo incorporate it, thinly slice about 2 cups of green or Savoy cabbage and add it to the pot at the same time as the potatoes and broth. If you prefer a rustic soup with texture, you can sauté the cabbage with the leeks and onions first until slightly wilted, then simmer. If you plan to blend the soup into a smooth purée, just ensure the cabbage is chopped small so it softens thoroughly before blending.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that cabbage can absorb a fair amount of liquid and salt. You may need to add an extra 1/2 cup of vegetable broth or water to maintain the silky consistency, and be sure to taste for seasoning at the end, as you might need an extra pinch of salt or a splash more lemon juice to balance the additional sweetness of the cabbage."
