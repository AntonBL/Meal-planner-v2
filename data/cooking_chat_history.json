    "content": "To incorporate basil, parsley, and cilantro like a pesto, your best approach is to create a **\"Gremolata-Pesto\" topper**. Since these herbs are delicate, you should not simmer them in the soup, as they will lose their vibrant color and flavor. Instead, pulse a handful of each herb with a clove of garlic, a splash of olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a pinch of salt until you reach a coarse, paste-like consistency. If you want to lean into the Mediterranean profile, add a tablespoon of toasted pine nuts or walnuts to the mix for texture.\n\nWhen the soup is finished cooking, ladle it into bowls and swirl a generous tablespoon of the herb mixture onto the surface. The heat from the lentils will release the aroma of the basil and cilantro without dulling their brightness. This technique adds a fresh, zesty contrast to the bold red pepper flakes and acidic tomatoes in the base. If you have any leftover herb paste, you can thin it with more oil and use it as a flavorful dip for crusty bread to serve alongside the soup."

    "content": "To make a balanced batch of Spicy Mediterranean Lentil Soup (approx. 6 servings), use the following amounts for the soup base:\n\n*   **Sauté:** 1 large onion, 2 large carrots, and 2 stalks of celery (all diced) in 2 tbsp olive oil.\n*   **Aromatics & Spices:** 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 tsp red pepper flakes (adjust for spice), 1 tsp dried thyme, and 2 bay leaves.\n*   **Base:** 1.5 cups brown lentils (rinsed), 1 can (14.5 oz) diced or fresh tomatoes, and 6–7 cups vegetable broth.\n*   **Seasoning:** 1 tsp salt and ½ tsp black pepper (to taste), plus the juice of half a lemon added at the very end.\n\nFor the **Triple-Herb Pesto**, combine ½ cup fresh basil, ½ cup fresh parsley, and ½ cup fresh cilantro (leaves and tender stems). Pulse these with 1 clove of garlic, 3–4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and 1 tbsp lemon juice until it forms a bright green paste. If you don't have enough of one herb, you can adjust the ratios as long as you have about 1.5 cups of greens total. \n\nSimmer the soup for 25–30 minutes until the lentils are tender but not mushy. Remove the bay leaves before serving, then top each bowl with a dollop of the pesto. If the soup becomes too thick as the lentils absorb the liquid, simply splash in a little extra broth or water to reach your desired consistency."

    "content": "For this soup, aim for a **small dice (about ¼ to ½ inch)** for your onions, carrots, and celery. Since lentils cook relatively quickly (25–30 minutes), chopping the vegetables into small, uniform pieces ensures they soften at the same rate as the legumes. A smaller dice also allows you to get a bit of everything—lentils, broth, and aromatic vegetables—in every spoonful.\n\nFor the **tomatoes**, if you are using fresh ones instead of canned, dice them slightly larger (about ½ inch) as they will break down and melt into the broth during the simmering process. If you prefer a more rustic, \"chunky\" soup, you can go up to a ½ inch dice for the carrots and celery, but keep the onions finely minced so they translucent and blend into the base without leaving large, crunchy bits.\n\n**Pro tip:** To save time, you can pulse the onion, carrots, and celery in a food processor a few times until they are roughly chopped, but be careful not to over-process them into a paste. You want distinct pieces of vegetable to provide texture against the soft lentils and the smooth herb pesto."
