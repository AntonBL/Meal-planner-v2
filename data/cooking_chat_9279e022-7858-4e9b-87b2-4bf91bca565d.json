    "content": "To substitute for **amchur powder** (dried mango powder), you need an ingredient that provides a sharp, concentrated sourness without adding too much moisture. The best option for this dry curry is **lemon or lime juice**. Since amchur is added at the end of the cooking process to provide a bright finish, squeeze half a citrus over the pan just before serving. Use about 1 tablespoon of juice for every 1 teaspoon of amchur called for.\n\nIf you prefer to keep the dish dry, **tamarind paste** or **anardana (pomegranate powder)** are excellent traditional alternatives. If those aren't available, a splash of **apple cider vinegar** works well to cut through the starchiness of the potatoes and delicata squash. Regardless of which substitute you choose, start with a small amount and taste as you go, as these alternatives can be more pungent than the relatively mellow, fruity tartness of amchur."

    "content": "Both **chunky chaat masala** and **tamarind** are excellent substitutes for amchur in this sabzi. Since amchur provides a tart, fruity finish, **tamarind paste** is your best bet for matching that deep, tangy flavor. Use about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of tamarind paste, thinning it with a tiny splash of warm water if it’s very thick so it coats the cabbage and squash evenly. Add it during the final 5 minutes of cooking to ensure the sourness melds with the spices without making the vegetables soggy.\n\n**Chaat masala** is also a great option, as its primary ingredient is usually amchur powder. However, be cautious: chaat masala is a spice blend that contains black salt (kala namak), cumin, and often a significant amount of extra salt. If you use it, sprinkle about 1 teaspoon over the dish at the very end, but **reduce the amount of additional salt** you add to the recipe to avoid over-seasoning. Using both is also an option—a small dab of tamarind for tartness and a light dusting of chaat masala for a savory, \"zingy\" finish."
